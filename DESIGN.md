# Design Document
This file should discuss how you implemented your project and why you made the design decisions you did, both technical and ethical. Your design document as a whole should be at least several paragraphs in length. Whereas your README.md is meant to be a userâ€™s manual, consider your DESIGN.md your opportunity to give the staff a tour of your project underneath its hood.

## Technical Decisions
### In this section, share and justify the technical decisions you made.
* Some challenges that I ran into while building this project was implementing a save and load function. I had a hard time getting the variables to all save and update when they were supposed to. Additionally, I attempted to create a matrix background and after hours and hours of effort, I gave up and decided to use on that I found online by the user Xizi0n. I really enjoy how it looks and hope to be able to implement something of the kind on my own some day. I also struggled to get the layout of my game the way I wanted it. Specifically, the two gifs I used gave me a lot of pain when trying to get the lined up correctly and have the right gif be on top. I decided to keep it simple and use a lot of buttons which I am comfortable working with. I used 'getElementById()' often and added a function to each button I implemented. For the implementation of the 'times2()' function, I was orginally planning on having it double the code per second of each of the upgrades but was having trouble figuring it out. Because of this, I decided it would be easier to just multiply the overall code per second by 2. The other upgrades were all somewhat similar and updated a few variables regarding the amount of code the user gains. I have played countless idle games in my life and definitely took inspiration from a lot of them.


## Ethical Decisions
### What motivated you to complete this project? What features did you want to create and why?
* I wanted to complete this project for fun. I really enjoy idle games and have been wanting to make one for a while now. This was finally my chance to do it and I am glad I was able to. I added a lot of features that I have seen in most other idle games and tried to think of a few that were unique to my game, although it was rather difficult. I wanted to create a simple idle game with a coding theme and I think I was successful in that.


### Who are the intended users of your project? What do they want, need, or value?
* The intended user for this project is anyone who wants to play a simple clicker game. I hope that someone can get some enjoyement out of my game and possibly be inspired to create their own. I believe the user values creativity so I tried to implement some features that I thought were creative both visually and functionally.



### How does your project's impact on users change as the project scales up?
* I don't think that the scaling of this project would be an issue as it is just a game. I would hope at some point I can return to this game and continue to build on what I have done now. I think this project is very easy to use and understand. There are already a ton of games like this that are massively popular so the social concern is low.
